# Stacker
## By Dave Haynes

This is my 2nd game, the goal is to get to the top of the gameboard by stacking blocks on top of each other.

You use the space bar to stop the blocks at any point.

If the blocks dont stop on top of other blocks, then you lose those blocks.

Development options for the future.
- different levels
- leaderboard
