GA WDI Project Zero.

Task was to build a working tic tac toe program using the javascript we leant in the first 2 weeks of the course.
And then once that is completed, go on to add new features or do a new game

TIC TAC TOE

The Tic Tac Toe game that I built had the following features
- ability to play 1, 3 or 5 games
- Enter User name
- Select character from list of characters
- Add animation at end of single win
- Add animation at end of multi win

The most interest part of this assignment (apart from creating my first animations) was the logic in getting a win.
When I initially did this it didnt take me long but ended up being somewhere in the realm of 50-60 lines of code.
I took a second look and found a few other ways of doing this, but my final version was reduced to just over 10 lines of code.
This was a good lesson that there are many ways to solve a problem and getting the most efficient version is the goal.

STACKER

Based upon the old arcade game, the purpose is to stack the blocks on top of each other and try and get to the top.
Any blocks which do not line up with the blocks below get lost and the game gets faster the higher you get.

This was my first attempt at having user interaction with moving parts.
This was very daunting initially but acutally became quite simple.
Once I let go of the idea that the same block needs to move from one square to the next, and really all i need to do is remove a block from one and add a block to another, this became quite an easy game to create.
The other thing this taught me was the importance of styling, as I think the game looks pretty good but would never consider myself a designer, but if you remove the background image then the game looks pretty awful.
